/**
 * Centralised cache policies — single source of truth for every TTL the
 * runtime caches use. Keeping the numbers here (instead of inline literals
 * scattered across the stores) makes it cheap to coordinate behaviour and
 * to spot drift when adding a new layer.
 *
 * Naming convention:
 *   `*_STALE_MS`  → stale-while-revalidate threshold. Cache returns
 *                   immediately, a background refresh fires only when
 *                   the data is older than this.
 *   `*_TTL_MS`    → hard TTL. Cache entry stops being served past this.
 *
 * If you add a new cache layer in the rxdb-store package, please:
 *   1. Add its constant here with a brief comment on what it gates.
 *   2. Import the constant where you use it; do NOT inline the literal.
 *   3. If the doc `breedhub-docs/frontend/app/data/CACHE_AUDIT_2026_04_28.md`
 *      mentions a new W#/P# item, update it to reference this file.
